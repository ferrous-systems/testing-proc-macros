See [accompanying blog post][post] for details.

Note that the blog post was written against a specific version of the compiler and crate dependencies.
This sample code is configured to use those specific versions: see `rust-toolchain.toml` and `Cargo.lock`.
Things may have changed since then; please do *not* submit pull requests to update dependencies or change `rust-toolchain.toml`.
